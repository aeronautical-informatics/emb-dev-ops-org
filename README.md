# EmbDevOps Organisation

Repository for initial organisation and code exchange for the SMART4ALL project __EmbDevOps__.

## Motivation

- DevOps pretty new in embeddes system
- Want to create buisness example here to push Devops in embedded
- From pikei no only embedded customers, but use smartmeters for water management for example

- Create roadmap with technologies and check what they are gaining
- Exchanging Powerpoint presentations in the beginning

- Services on operating system on raspberry pi, not bare metal

## First ideas

Using the TAWS research project from the Aeronautical Informatics institute https://github.com/aeronautical-informatics/openTAWS/blob/main/README.md and configure it in such a way to use it in an embedded platform.

For this CI/CD with Gherkin and github actions might be applicable to show an examplary DevOps cycle within a simulation environment.

## 2021-03-24
- They want roadmap explaining what experience we will convey
- This is the plan:
    - CI/CD
    - Design Gherkin Tests
    - Rust as new technology
    - Gitlab actions will conduct cucumber testing
    - CD with (Q?)EMU
- Formulate this in document (1-2 pages)
    - Introduce technologies
    - Give plan and process
